# Deezer search react app 
This is a react app with TypeScript intended to query the [Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/api "Deezer api"). This app uses a local REST API to be used as an interface between the Deezer api and the React app. The local api is found [Here](https://github.com/brungo1995/express_bff "Rest api").

## Prerequisites
 * Node Js installed at least version 10

## How to run the api
 * Clone the repo
 * On the root folder run 
```bash
    npm install
```
 * This should install all dependencies
 * Make sure that the [Local Rest API](https://github.com/brungo1995/express_bff "Rest api") is up and running otherwise, you won't be able to query the API 
 * Then run 
 ```bash
    npm run start
```
 * The start script will start the app on port 3000 if available and launch the browser 
 * Enjoy the APP ðŸŽ‰
